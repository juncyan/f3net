The paper has been accepted by [JSTARS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540196)

f3net torch code. 

weights, and program are created using paddle.

F3Net program: [AI Studio](https://aistudio.baidu.com/projectdetail/7967708?sUid=285037&shared=1&ts=1717043536848)

F3Net weights can be found at [Baidu](https://aistudio.baidu.com/datasetdetail/250593) or [GoogleCloud](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YbskRCxcS6AhDsuiIM38WYYiiB5o-rfu/view?usp=sharing), and the complete code will be released after the paper is accepted.
